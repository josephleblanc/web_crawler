                <p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">The boy with two souls awoke to the cries of gulls.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">He opened his eyes and stared dumbly at the sky. Tiny white specks circled and dove amidst the backdrop of the burning sun. The smell of salt rang in the air. Sand shifted beneath him when he moved.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">“Where…am I?” he mumbled.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em"><em>I need to stand up and survey the surroundings,</em> a deep, gruff voice said in his ear. <em>Establish a defensive… wait. What is this?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">“Gah!” the boy shouted, scrambling to his feet. He looked around wildly and only saw an indigo sea hemmed in by sand. Seafoam gurgled on the ebbing waves. But nobody else was here…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">His arm suddenly jerked to the left, and he yelped.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em"><em>Aha!</em> the voice said triumphantly. <em>Now I’m getting the hang of it!</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">“Hey!” the boy snapped at his left arm flailing about randomly. “Quit it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em"><em>What kind of dark magic have you done to me, boy?!</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">His traitorous left hand reached up and grabbed a fistful of his hair, shaking him about.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">“Stop that!” the boy yelled, gripping his left arm with his right. “Hey, give me my arm back!”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em"><em><span style="color: rgba(35, 111, 161, 1)"><strong>[SYSTEM ERROR]: THIS BEING EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF SOULS ALLOTTED FOR ITS RACE. TERMINATION IN 5… 4…</strong></span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">“Termination?!” the boy said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em"><em>Termination?!</em> the man in his head said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em"><em>Hey, kid, the voice said. You read those messages?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">“Don’t ‘Hey, kid,” me as if everything’s normal! Get out of my head!”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em"><em>Settle down. Didn’t you read the messages? We got some special kind of permit.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">“And? A simple message is supposed to make me okay with some stranger speaking directly into my head?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em"><em>Not the brightest, are we, boy? I’m not speaking directly into your head, I’m IN your head. IN your body. With deduction skills like that, you’d be eaten alive on the battlefield.&nbsp;</em></span><br><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">The boy gritted his teeth. Despite the truth in the invaders words, he couldn’t help but feel disarray. There’s another being inside of him! Was he supposed to just accept that and move on?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">He sighed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">“H-how are you so okay with this? This is insane! I have no idea where I am, how I got here, and I’m supposed to now walk around with another person IN my body?” he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em"><em>There’s no point in worrying about what you can’t control, kid. You need to learn to accept things the way they are and make do with what you’ve been given. Instead of wasting energy worrying, put it to use on more productive things, like finding out where the hell we are. Now get to your feet. We need to get a grasp on what in Kravan’s name is going on here.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">The boy frowned and opened his mouth to retort but shut it soon after. There was a air of authority and confidence in the intruders voice, and the boy couldn’t help but feel compelled by it. Not that he was happy about it…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 1.1em">“Ok, ok. I’ll check our surroundings. I doubt we’ll find anything but sand though…”&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Arthur did a weird half-dash forward before lurching to a halt, his bare feet skidding in the sand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">“Hey!” he snapped at Iskander, who he could feel urging to run forward. “Knock it off! How do you think I’m gonna beat a crab like this?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Worry not, Arthur. You fear it because you lack experience, not because it's insurmountable. With my guidance, we’ll clear this tu…torial? Right? Whatever it is! We’ll clear it and make off with our rewards!</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Arthur’s disagreement was almost audible as he took shaking steps back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">No way. That’s not happening. It's the size of an elephant! I don’t know what battles you’ve fought in your life, but no ordinary human can beat that stampeding, elephant-sized crab. We’re running!” </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">But again, his body wasn’t fully listening to his commands. He had gone to turn tail and escape, but his legs were like stone, dragging heavily through the sand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">“Iskander! You need to stop this or you’re gonna get us both killed!” he shouted, his heart beating in his throat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? I didn’t do anything, runt! I only thought it would be nice if you could work with me here so we can do what we’ve been tasked with doing. Perhaps my will is overpowering that of your own; a power struggle, if you will, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Iskander said with more gloat than Arthur liked. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">So what are you saying? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Arthur complained to himself. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">That I’m spineless? </span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The crab lumbered forward, each of its pincers large enough to cut Arthur in half. Long strands of seaweed clung to its shell like tattered clothes. Its beady eyes were utterly empty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Arthur gripped his fists till his knuckles turned white. “Tell me, Iskander. If we fight…can we win?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know. There’s no battle in this world that's won before you fight it. But if we let uncertainty hold us back, we’ll never be able to move forward. Throw caution to the wind and trust in me, I won’t let you die! </span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The resistance in Arthur’s legs vanished. If he wanted he was free to run for the hills and never see that crab ever again. But if such desires still drove him, perhaps his legs would still be shaking?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Arthur dashed towards the crab, his breathing ragged with fear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The walking boulder picked up its pace with each step it took, slowly coming into a charge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">“What’s the plan?” Arthur shouted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that’s more like it! </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Iskander said. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">We need to use its claws against it. The tutorial thing said it, but I also can’t see how we’re expected to defeat it any other way. </span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">“I get your line of thought, but how will that help me kill it? You do have a plan, right!?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Our skills! Soul Push! Soul Pull! Did you not read what they do? </span></em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Iskander laughed. The bloody bastard laughed at him!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">I should’ve expected as much from you, kid. I’ll explain that after we win. For now, I’m going to need you to use Push on its claws. Get them as high in the air as you possibly can, understand? We have no time to hesitate, I’ll guide you as you go!</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Use Push? Was Arthur supposed to just instinctively understand how to do that? He thought back to the shiny blue screen that appeared just moments ago, focusing his memory on the words “Soul Push” labeled under his Skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The crab was closer now, its claws open and clamping like a vice ready to snap Arthur’s head off his body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Use Push on its claws. Use Push on its claws, </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Arthur thought over and over to himself. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">In the base of his feet, Arthur felt a power surge. It flowed through his legs and into his torso like a river before coursing into his outstretched hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Perfect! Now slide underneath it and swap with m—</span></em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">“Eh?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The crab gurgled, as if in defiance to Arthur’s Push, and swung its claws towards him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Get out of the way, Arthur! </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Iskander shouted.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Arthur was still. His eyes locked on the pair of claws that barrelled towards him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">An image flashed in his mind. Lights. Blindingly bright lights. Glass, sharp as razor blades. Bones breaking…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Arthur felt his legs move on their own, throwing him to the ground and into a tumble. The claws snapped high over the crab’s head with a resounding </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">crack</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Come… on… kid… </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Iskander grunted, and Arthur’s body awkwardly rolled out of the way as the crab made another attack. He sucked in a shaky breath and scrambled to his feet and ran.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">“I’m…I’m sorry,” Arthur mumbled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t be sorry! Just focus on not making the same mistake. I’m partly to blame for this seeing as my plan was flawed. We’re too weak to enact our skills upon it. </span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The fuzz in Arthur’s mind finally cleared. “Then…we can’t fight it? What are we supposed to do, then!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Iskander willed Arthur backwards as the crabs claw swiped past his face, slicing a thin cut on the round of his cheek. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Pay attention! You don’t get to lose focus on the battlefield!</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Arthur grit his teeth. “Stop taking control of my body! If you would've just let me handle things, we wouldn’t be in this mess anyways!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Then you need to focus! If you let your will slip, mine will come through. So you need to keep your wits about you and—</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Again, Arthur had his body hijacked as Iskander pushed him out of the way of yet another attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">—and stop dozing off in the middle of battle! </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Iskander snapped as Arthur spat sand out of his mouth. He shoved himself to his feet and darted out of the crab’s path.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would’ve moved out of the way myself,” Arthur growled under his breath. “Leave my body </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">alone</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">.” </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><span style="font-weight: 400">Iskander scoffed. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">A little gratitude is in order, kid.</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The crab charged forward, big bunches of sand thrown to the side in its wake. Arthur tried to run to the right on instinct, but Iskander tried to push his legs to go to the left, away from the sea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">“Iskander, stop!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Kid, just listen to me!</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The crab barrelled forward, pincers out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Arthur gasped and stumbled in place, the two motions cancelling each other out. Iskander grunted and went silent. A wave of dizzying vertigo flooded through Arthur, and he dropped to his knees, dazed. His vision blurred, and in one eye he saw the crab and the palm trees and the blue sky; but in the other he was on a road as a truck thundered toward him, and screams reached towards the stars…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone, save me! </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Arthur screamed inwardly.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">From the distance, a projectile. It cut through the air like a hot knife through soft cheese and slammed between him and the crab with a resounding impact, sending sand spraying everywhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino"><em><span style="font-weight: 400">A spear? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">Iskander thought in a slightly shaken tone.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">A high-pitched whine rang in Arthur’s ears before resolving into a deep hum, and with a flash of blue light a shirtless man appeared beside the spear. Deeply tanned with long brown hair, he only wore a pair of linen shorts and cork sandals, and in his left hand was a bag of still-squirming fish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">With his right hand, he gripped the spear and made a smooth swinging motion. The tiny bells that hung off the tassel at the end of the hilt rang lightly in the air as a powerful gust of wind picked up and blew against the crab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The crab skidded to a halt. It clacked its pincers nervously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">“Go,” the man ordered, pointing a stern finger at the crustacean. “Or I’ll eat you.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">The crab gurgled and moved forward a bit before deciding against it. With an angry clack of its claws, it quickly scurried back to the sea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 1.1em; font-family: georgia, palatino">Shaken and confused, Arthur let loose a tightly coiled breath. “Oh thank God—”</span></p>
